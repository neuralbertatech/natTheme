Version 2 brings a lot of changes, but most of them relate
to the internal mechanisms of the library and in most cases it will be enough
for you to switch to the current syntax without semantic changes.

## Component Renames

Now:
- `createForm3` -> `createForm`
- `createValidator2` -> `createFormValidator`
- `RawForm` -> `BasicForm`
- `Form2` -> `SimpleForm`

The logic behind component naming is as follows: `BasicForm` - provides
only basic functionality, while `SimpleForm` - provides a simple way to
instantiate a form.

## The `theme` is now a single function.

This change allows fields, widget templates and components to be
overridden/added simultaneously and type-safe thanks to
the `@sjsf/form/lib/resolver` library.

To make it work you need to remove `...` before `theme`.

```ts
import { theme } from '@sjsf/your-theme'

const form = createForm({ theme, ... })
```

Example of field override:

```ts
import { overrideByRecord } from "@sjsf/form/lib/resolver";
import { theme } from '@sjsf/your-theme';

import MyField from './my-field';

const myTheme = overrideByRecord(theme, {
  fieldTemplate: MyField,
})
```

## The number of components in the default theme has been reduced

It was found out that the following fields and widgets are enough to display any JSON schema:
- `stringField` ,`numberField` ,`integerField` ,`booleanField` ,`objectField` ,`arrayField` ,`tupleField` ,`nullField` ,`oneOfField` ,`anyOfField`
- `textWidget`, `numberWidget`, `selectWidget`, `checkboxWidget`

Therefore, all other fields and widgets are placed in optional `extra` modules.

You can import them directly or use special imports to connect them automatically.

```ts
import { useDatePickerForDateFormat } from "@sjsf/form/fields/extra-widgets/date-picker";
// Include extra fields
import "@sjsf/form/fields/extra-fields/boolean-select-include";
import "@sjsf/form/fields/extra-fields/enum-include";
import "@sjsf/form/fields/extra-fields/file-include";
import "@sjsf/form/fields/extra-fields/files-include";
import "@sjsf/form/fields/extra-fields/multi-enum-include";
// Include extra widget for basic theme
import { theme as basicTheme } from "@sjsf/basic-theme";
import '@sjsf/basic-theme/extra-widgets/checkboxes-include';
import '@sjsf/basic-theme/extra-widgets/file-include';
import "@sjsf/basic-theme/extra-widgets/multi-select-include";
import "@sjsf/basic-theme/extra-widgets/textarea-include";
import "@sjsf/basic-theme/extra-widgets/radio-include";
import "@sjsf/basic-theme/extra-widgets/date-picker-include";

const theme = useDatePickerForDateFormat(basicTheme);

const from = createForm({ theme, ... })
```

However `extra` fields will not be used automatically,
for this you need to use the new `resolver` property or
explicitly replace one field with another in `uiSchema`.

## New required `resolver` property

Previously, the logic for selecting a field to display the schema was spread across multiple components and could not be changed without replacing those components (`RootField`, `ArrayField`).

Now this logic is placed in a separate function `resolver`, which allows to change/extend this algorithm without affecting UI components.

Therefore, you must add this property when calling `createForm` and `SimpleForm`

```ts
import { resolver } from '@sjsf/from/resolvers/basic'
// Or a variant reproducing the logic of the v1
import { resolver } from '@sjsf/from/resolvers/compat'

const form = createForm({ resolver, ... })
```

## `UiSchema` overhaul

Properties `ui:widget`, `ui:field` and `ui:templates` are merged into `ui:components`.

This property allows you to replace one component with another if they are compatible.

```ts
import MyLayout from "./my-layout.svelte";

const uiSchema: UiSchema = {
  "ui:components": {
    textWidget: "textareaWidget",
    layout: MyLayout,
  }
}
```

Properties such as `input`, `content`, `container`, `button` and `form`
have been removed from `ui:options`. Now each theme independently defines
a set of ui options allowing to customize its components.

Motivation - different themes use different base components and their properties
may not be compatible. For example for `textWidget` from `basic-theme` it
is `HTMLInputAttributes` and for `flowbite-theme` it is `InputProps`.

## Validators overhaul

Now the validator is just a set of functions:

- `isValid` (called to correctly handle the following keywords `oneOf`, `anyOf` and `if,then,else`, required)
- `validateFormValue` (optional)
- `validateFormValueAsync` (optional)
- `validateFieldValue` (optional)
- `validateFieldValueAsync` (optional)
- `validateAdditionalPropertyKey` (optional)

So now you can easily extend/modify the validator to suit your needs.

```ts
import type { ErrorObject } from "ajv";
import { isSchemaObjectValue } from "@sjsf/form/core";
import type { FormValueValidator } from "@sjsf/form";
import { createFormValidator } from "@sjsf/ajv8-validator";

export function createValidator() {
  const validator = createFormValidator();
  return {
    ...validator,
    validateFormValue(rootSchema, formValue) {
      const errors = validator.validateFormValue(rootSchema, formValue);
      // Your logic
      return errors
    },
  } satisfies FormValueValidator<ErrorObject>;
}
```

## `Checkbox`, `Range` and `Switch` widgets behavior

In `v1` those widgets would set its field to some default value if its value was `undefined` (this behavior can be observed when using `<input type=“checkbox” bind:checked ...` )

In `v2` this behavior was removed to keep the behavior uniform with other primitive input elements.

To reproduce the previous behavior, add `default: <some default value>` to the JSON schema.

## The form state `validate` method has been removed

Replace with the following code:

```ts
import { groupErrors } from "@sjsf/form";
...
const errors = groupErrors(validator.validateFormValue(schema, form.value));
```

## Etc.

There are actually a lot more changes in this release, but considering their
nature (mostly internal) and the number of active users at the moment
(small relative to `rjsf`) I think it is not rational to try to create a
comprehensive guide.
