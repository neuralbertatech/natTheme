import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

import basicResolverCode from '#/form/src/form/resolvers/basic?raw'
import compatResolverCode from '#/form/src/form/resolvers/compat?raw'

To determine which field to use to display your JSON schema,
the form uses `resolver` function.

Let's take a look at the `basic` resolver implementation
(`@sjsf/form/resolvers/basic`):

<Code code={basicResolverCode} lang='typescript' />

As you can see `resolver` just selects the field according to the schema type.

This approach is simple and straightforward, but in some cases it can lead to
additional work.
Suppose you have the following scheme:

```ts
const schema: Schema = {
  enum: ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
}
```

For this scheme, the `basic` resolver will select `stringField`,
and `stringField` will display the `textWidget` widget by default
although you probably wanted to see select or radio widgets.

To achieve this you need to specify in the UI scheme the field:

```ts
const uiSchema: UiSchema = {
  "ui:components": {
    // The `selectWidget` will now be displayed by default
    stringField: "enumField",
    // You can also replace `selectWidget` with `radioWidget`
    // selectWidget: "radioWidget"
  }
}
```

Or you can modify `resolver` so that `enumField` is always used
when a scheme with `enum` is detected:

```ts
return ({ schema }) => {
  if (schema.enum !== undefined) {
    return "enumField"
  }
  ...
}
```

It is recommended that you copy the `basic` resolver code into your project and
modify it to suit your needs.

As an example (or temporary solution) you can use the `compat` resolver
(`@sjsf/form/resolvers/compat`) that reproduces resolution logic from v1:

<Code code={compatResolverCode} lang='typescript' />
